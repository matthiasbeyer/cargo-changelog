# cargo-changelog

Changelog management tool for CLI.

`cargo-changelog` is a merge-friendly changelog management utility.

## Getting Started

⚠️ `cargo-changelog` is still in alpha and will change and evolve. Do not use it
unless you are ready to, potentially manually, upgrade configuration and/or
templates on a regular basis.

With that out of the way, to get started with `cargo-changelog` is to install it,
and running `cargo changelog init`.

If you are running this on a new project, you are good to go and can directly
start building and adding changelog entries.

If you are planning to use `cargo-changelog` on an already ongoing project,
your old CHANGELOG.md will have moved to `.changelogs/suffix.md` and will be
appended to the generated changelog. Be sure to update it so that it can
seamlessly integrate with the generated one.

## Usage

`cargo-changelog` is a tool to generate and manage changelog entries.

It works in the following way:

- Everytime you add/change/fix something and want to document it, you create a
  new changelog entry with `cargo changelog add`
- Then, when a new version is released, you run `cargo changelog create-release
  <bump>` to move all unreleased changes to either the next patch/minor/major
  version
- Finally, you re-generate the CHANGELOG.md file using `cargo changelog release`

Here's how they work individually:

### cargo changelog add

`cargo changelog add` generates a new changelog file in the unreleased
changelog directory. Per default that is `.changelogs/unreleased`.
If interactive mode is enabled, which it is per-default, then you will be
prompted to fill in the fields of the changelog as well as a larger free-form
entry where you can explain the motivation and consequences of the changes.

### cargo changelog create-release <bump>

Once you are done with one release, `cargo-changelog create-release <version>`
(for example `cargo changelog create-release minor` for the next minor version)
will take all unreleased changelogs and move them to `/.changelogs/0.1.0` (if
"0.1.0" is your next minor version - you can of course also specify an explicit
version with the `create-release` subcommand).

### cargo changelog generate

After that you can create your final `CHANGELOG.md` file using
`cargo-changelog generate`

This will take all released changelog entries and generate a new file,
overwriting the old.

-------

## Configuration

You can configure `cargo-changelog` in `/changelog.toml` and add mandatory or
optional metadata fields to your changelog entries. You can also specify a
template file that gets used when rendering your changelogs to your final
`CHANGELOG.md` file.

### Suffix

If you wish to add something to the CHANGELOG that gets appended to the end of
the file, you can create a `suffix.md` in your changelog directory (per default
`.changelogs`).

This is also where the `cargo changelog init` moves your existing CHANGELOG.md
if you had one while running the command.
